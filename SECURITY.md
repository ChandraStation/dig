# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security problem that must be privately disclosed, please know:

1) We will pay you for identifying the problem.
2) We will pay you even more for fixing the problem.
3) The best channel is to privately DM @gadikian on twitter.

Thank you.
